',\n",
       " '  He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities of a _Yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race, as the _Yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, I mentioned a custom we had of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the word _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might be practised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the _Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which, as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are not till twelve. ',\n",
       " '  When my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called _nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down. ',\n",
       " ' After a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair of the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence at his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a _Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company; that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim back to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was utterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the _Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse from labour.

       " '  My sail was likewise composed of the skins of the same animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get, the older being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with four paddles. ',\n",
       " '  After dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so desperate an attempt; assured me, “he only meant to do me all the service he was able;” and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.

       " '  As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour. ',\n",

I shall say nothing of those remote nations where _Yahoos_ preside; among which the least corrupted are the _Brobdingnagians_; whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe.
